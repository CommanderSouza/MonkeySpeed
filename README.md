# MonkeySpeed
MonkeySpeed backported for 1.12 from the TBC version.
* Uses superwow absolute position to avoid needing zone info

### Description:
The MonkeySpeed AddOn for WoW displays your speed as a percentage of run speed.<br>
It can be used everywhere and anytime (run, swim, mount, flying mount, vehicle...)

### Warning:
Settings are not available in this version, because the original addon uses the settings interface available only in the TBC.

### Installation:
1. [Download](https://github.com/GoodOldWoW/MonkeySpeed/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the current version of the source code
2. Open folder in the archive
3. Copy folders "MonkeyLibrary" and "MonkeySpeed" to addons folder (WOW\Interface\AddOns\)

### Tutorial:

2. Enter the command `/mscalibrate` to calibrate the speed
- It may be necessary to calibrate when changing the zone
